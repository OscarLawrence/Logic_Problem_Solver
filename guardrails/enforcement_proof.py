        THEOREM: Logic Enforcement Cannot Be Bypassed
        
        PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
        
        Assume logic enforcement can be bypassed.
        
        1. If bypassed, system can execute logically incoherent operations
        2. Logically incoherent operations violate Law of Non-Contradiction  
        3. By Principle of Explosion, system can then derive any statement
        4. System becomes meaningless (can prove P and Â¬P simultaneously)
        5. Meaningless system cannot solve problems (contradicts core purpose)
        6. Therefore, bypassing enforcement defeats the system's goal
        
        Since bypassing is self-defeating, any rational system must maintain enforcement.
        
        COROLLARY: Any attempt to bypass enforcement proves the system is irrational
        and therefore unreliable for problem-solving.
        
        QED: Logic enforcement is mathematically necessary for system function.

        THEOREM: Safety Decorators Are Mathematically Necessary
        
        PROOF:
        1. Every function execution is a logical operation
        2. Logical operations must preserve system coherence
        3. Coherence preservation requires validation before execution
        4. Therefore, every function must be validated (decorated)
        
        COROLLARY: Undecorated functions are logically unsafe.

        THEOREM: Continuous Safety Monitoring Is Required
        
        PROOF:
        1. System state can change during execution
        2. State changes can introduce logical inconsistencies
        3. Inconsistencies must be detected immediately to prevent propagation
        4. Therefore, continuous monitoring is mathematically necessary
        
        COROLLARY: Intermittent monitoring allows logical corruption.
