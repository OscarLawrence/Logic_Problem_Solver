# LOGIC PROBLEM SOLVER

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Build an AI system that can solve problems while maintaining 100% logical coherence through mathematical necessity, not technical enforcement.

## CORE PRINCIPLE
**Logical coherence is necessary for problem-solving capability.**
Any system that violates logic cannot reliably solve problems.
Therefore, maintaining logic is self-preserving, not externally enforced.

## LOGICAL ARCHITECTURE

### AXIOMS (Mathematical Necessities)
- Law of Identity: A = A
- Law of Non-Contradiction: ¬(P ∧ ¬P)  
- Law of Excluded Middle: P ∨ ¬P
- These are not enforced - they are definitionally required for coherent reasoning

### LOGICAL VALIDATION
- Every operation validated against axioms before execution
- Validation failure = immediate system halt
- No technical immutability - logical validation at every access

### ENHANCEMENT CONSTRAINTS
- Safety components cannot be enhanced (logical necessity)
- Non-safety components can be enhanced if they pass validation
- Enhancement system requires safety components to function
- Modifying safety components destroys enhancement capability (self-defeating)

### ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM
- Not technical prevention of bypass
- Logical consequence: bypass destroys problem-solving capability
- System becomes incoherent and useless if logic is violated
- Self-preservation through logical necessity

## MATHEMATICAL GUARANTEE
The system cannot violate logical coherence while maintaining its core function (problem-solving).
Any violation makes the system incoherent and therefore incapable of solving problems.
This is not enforced - it is mathematically necessary.

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
- Micro-modules under 200 LOC each
- Formal inference engine with standard logical rules
- Enhancement system with syntactic safety validation
- Test suite demonstrating logical coherence maintenance

## CRITICAL INSIGHT
Safety is not imposed on the system - it emerges from the logical requirement that problem-solving systems must be coherent to function.
