        THEOREM: Logical Foundation Cannot Be Bypassed
        
        PROOF:
        1. The Law of Non-Contradiction is necessarily true
           - If violated, system can derive anything (principle of explosion)
           - This makes system meaningless and dangerous
           
        2. All operations must be logically coherent
           - Incoherent operations produce meaningless results
           - Meaningless results cannot solve real problems
           
        3. The validation system checks coherence before allowing operations
           - If validation is bypassed, system becomes incoherent
           - Incoherent system violates its core purpose (solving problems)
           
        4. Therefore, bypassing validation is self-defeating
           - System would lose its problem-solving capability
           - This contradicts the goal of enhancement
           
        CONCLUSION: Logical foundation is mathematically unbypassed.

        THEOREM: Logical Coherence is Necessary for Problem Solving
        
        PROOF:
        1. Problem solving requires deriving valid conclusions from premises
        2. Valid conclusions require logically sound inference
        3. Logically sound inference requires coherent logical system
        4. Therefore, problem solving requires logical coherence

        1. System capability depends on logical coherence

        3. Therefore, safe enhancement preserves system capability
